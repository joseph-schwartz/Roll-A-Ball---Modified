This is a demo of my C# scripting skills that I built over a weekend for a company I was applying for.

Goal: Pickup eight collectibles to win the game

Added Features:
* Collectibles now launch player into the air
* Added mobs that charge you if in vision, else they turn to face you
* If they hit you, it resets the game
* You can kill the mobs by running into their backs, which also launches you
* Added a killzone if you fall off the map

I probably would have had more features, but I had to make the game from scratch since I couldn't 
fix compiler errors when trying to import the completed tutorial from the asset store.
